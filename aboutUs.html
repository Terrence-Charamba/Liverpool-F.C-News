            <div class="NewsOverlay">
              <p>Liverpool's current head coach is Arne Slot. He took over the role in June 2024, succeeding JÃ¼rgen Klopp. Slot, a 45-year-old Dutch coach, was previously the head coach of Feyenoord, where he led the team to the league title in 2023 and was named Eredivisie Manager of the Year twice. He also won the KNVB Cup with Feyenoord in April 20241.

                Slot's appointment marks a new era for Liverpool as he brings his extensive experience and successful track record to the club. Do you think he'll be able to maintain Liverpool's high standards?</p>

                <div class="NewsOverlay">
                  <p>Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Liverpool's owners, are close to confirming the appointment of Pedro Marques as part of their new setup. Marques, currently the technical director at Benfica, is set to join FSG in a key role overseeing their football operations1. This move is seen as a significant coup for FSG, given Marques' strong reputation and extensive experience in football performance analysis and player development.

                    Marques previously worked with the City Football Group, where he helped develop coaching methodologies and performance analysis for multiple clubs. His appointment is part of FSG's strategy to transition into a multi-club ownership model and maintain a consistent style of play and culture across their clubs</p>
