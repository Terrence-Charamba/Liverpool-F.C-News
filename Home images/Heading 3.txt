Liverpool sit second in the Premier League, with the best defensive record and goal differential in the competition, and kicked off their Champions League campaign with a dominant win at one of Europe’s historic giants, so while stakes of the Carabao Cup might not get fans up like the other two potential trophies do, expectations will nonetheless be high, as they host West Ham at Anfield.

The Hammers haven’t been doing great so far this year, with a measly four points ensuring they sit 14th in the table after five games, but they did make it to the third round of the Carabao Cup after scraping a 1-0 win over Bournemouth courtesy of a late Jarrod Bowen strike.

Having ended their five-year David Moyes project, under which the Scot oversaw West Ham’s drop from top six contenders to perennial mid-table dwellers, the London club have gone continental, appointing former Spain and Real Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui to the chair in the summer.

The Spaniard is potentially looking at a fully fit squad tomorrow, as Niclas Füllkrug appears to have recovered from a calf injury just in time to contribute in the competition that likely serves as the club’s most plausible avenue for success this season.
