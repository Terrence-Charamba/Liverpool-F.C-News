Kelleher deputised for the injured Alisson and kept a clean sheet last time out as the Reds defeated AFC Bournemouth 3-0 at Anfield.

The Republic of Ireland international is set to retain the spot for the Carabao Cup third-round tie with West Ham United, as Alisson aims to be back in contention for the subsequent Premier League trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.

“It’s sure that Caoimh will be in goal tomorrow,” head coach Slot said at his pre-West Ham press conference.

“Alisson is getting there but I think this game is coming just a bit too early and we are looking at the weekend against Wolves, but it’s going to be tight so let’s see if he manages to be there.

“But he will not be there tomorrow so Caoimh will be in goal tomorrow, that’s the one thing I know for sure at this moment.

“I wasn’t surprised at all with his performance [against Bournemouth] because he was very good in pre-season already and he was very good with his national team as well.

“It’s a good thing for us that we have two quality players, and we forget the third one in this position because in almost every position we have two but in goalkeepers we have got three or four and our third one is also a really good goalkeeper. So it’s a good thing for us.

“Like you saw, we need to have a strong squad because you can pick up injuries or whatever can happen. So, it was good to see and pleasing to see that he kept a clean sheet – not in a way that he had nothing to do, he had to act a few times and he acted really well.”
