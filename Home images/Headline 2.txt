Diaz netted a quickfire double at Anfield on Saturday to help inspire the Reds to a 3-0 victory over AFC Bournemouth.

The Colombian opened the scoring in the 26th minute and then grabbed his other goal 120 seconds later.

Diaz, who also found the back of the net against Brentford and Manchester United (twice), took his 2024-25 tally in the league to five.
Only Mohamed Salah (2020-21) and Michael Owen (2000-01) have scored more in the first five fixtures of a campaign.

Owen also racked up five in five in 2003-04, as did Robbie Fowler in 1994-95.
"If you're wondering when did Luis Diaz get to five goals last season in the Premier League? February. So it just shows the improvement he's made this season.

"Absolutely outstanding, it really is."
